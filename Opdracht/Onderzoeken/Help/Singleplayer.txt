When you start the game, you click on two random cards. If the two cards are the same, you will get a point and the cards will disappear. If they are not, 
The cards will flip and you may try again. The game continues in this fashion until the board is empty.

SCORE:

By default you 10 points per correct pair but when you will receive -1 point for each wrong selected pair. This will be subtracted from the default points.
When you get multiple pairs in a row, you get a combo. This will activate a multiplier to your points. This means you will receive more points at once. 
A wrong pair turns the Multiplier off.
While playing you can see your score in the top right corner. When you finish your game, your score will be saved in the high score window.
