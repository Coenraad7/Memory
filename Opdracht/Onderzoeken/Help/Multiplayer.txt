WHAT IS MEMORY?:

Memory is a card game in which all of the cards are faced down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn.
The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. Memory can be played with any number of players or as solitaire. 
It is a particularly good game for young children, though adults may find it challenging and stimulating as well.
A memory game requires observation, concentration and a good memory to win.

Memory is also known as Match Match, Match Up, Concentration, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs.

WHAT IS THE GOAL?:

The object of the game is to collect the most matched pairs.

HOW TO PLAY?:

When you start the game, the first player clicks on two random cards. If the cards are not a match your turn is over
and it is now the next players turn. The next player chooses their two random cards. If the two cards are the same, you will get a point and 
the cards will disappear. If they are not, the cards will flip and you may try again. The game continues in this fashion until the board is empty.

HOW DO I WIN?:

For every correct pair you get a point. The one with most points at the end wins. 

HINT:

Just because it is another players turn doesn't mean you should stop paying attention. The cards that other players flip over could be the match you're 
looking for.
Distract your opponent when it is their turn. When the timer is zero it is your turn again.
